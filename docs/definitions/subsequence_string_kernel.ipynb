    "### Subsequence String Kernel (SSK) \n",
    "\n",
    "Presented by Lodhi *et. al.* in the paper Text Classification using String Kernels, *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 2, 419-444 (2002).\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence is any ordered sequence of $n$ characters occurring in the text, though not necessarily contiguous. More formally, string $u$ is a subsequence of string $s$, iff there exists indices $\\mathbf{i}=(i_{1},\\dots,i_{|u|})$, with $1\\le i_{1} \\le \\cdots \\le i_{|u|} \\le |s|$, such that $u_{j}=s_{i_{j}}$ for $j=1,\\dots,|u|$, written as $u=s[\\mathbf{i}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature mapping $\\phi$ in this scenario is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "   \\phi_{u}(s)=\\sum_{\\mathbf{i}:u=s[\\mathbf{i}]}\\lambda^{l(\\mathbf{i})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some $\\lambda\\le 1$, where $l(\\mathbf{i})$ is the length of the subsequence in $s$, given by $i_{|u|}-i_{1}+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel is an inner product in the feature space generated by all subsequences of length $n$.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\tK_{n}(s,t)=\\sum_{u\\in\\Sigma^{n}}\\langle \\phi_{u}(s), \\phi_{u}(t)\\rangle\n",
    "\t= \\sum_{u\\in\\Sigma^{n}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{i}:u=s[\\mathbf{i}]}\n",
    "\t\\sum_{\\mathbf{j}:u=t[\\mathbf{j}]}\\lambda^{l(\\mathbf{i})+l(\\mathbf{j})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the subsequences are weighted by the exponentially decaying factor $\\lambda$ of their full length in the text, more weight is given to those occurrences that are nearly contiguous. A direct computation is infeasible since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper of Lodhi *et. al.* describes an efficient computation approach using a dynamic programming technique. The computation is achieved using two auxiliary functions $K'$ and $K''$ which are defined as follows\n",
